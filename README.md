A random tinkerer in the computing world. As of 2021 I'm mainly an infra guy
in my open-source activities, focused on *making the LoongArch new world happen*.

Some of my more prominent community roles, in no particular order:

* Gentoo dev: [Gentoo/LoongArch](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:LoongArch) and the occasional toolchain/QEMU things
* [loongson-overlay](https://github.com/xen0n/loongson-overlay) (`::loongson`) maintainer
* Linux reviewer for `arch/loongarch`
* LLVM contributor to `Targets/LoongArch`
* @golang `loong64` porter
* Rust contributor: MIPS64 polishes in the past, LoongArch co-maintainer at present

My talks:

* [*LoongArch: What we will do next* / 《LoongArch：我们接下来干啥》](https://lpc.events/event/16/contributions/1178/), LPC 2022
* [*`GOARCH=loong64`: past, present, and future* / 《`GOARCH=loong64`: 昨天‧今天‧明天》](https://github.com/gopherchina/conference/blob/6feb86ee4cf7f3dba4898236803dd6a20d4a75ca/2023/1.2.1%20Go%20on%20Loong64.pdf), GopherChina 2023

Pronouns: he/him/they/them (The Chinese language doesn't have grammatical genders, and absolutely doesn't distinguish the third-person genders when spoken.)
